# CranioViewer

## This program integrated several functionalities:
1. Polygonal mesh view in Wavefront Obj file format
2. 3D CT data inspection in Nifti file format with 3 axis slice view and a 3D view
3. Rigid registration based on ICP
4. Non-rigid deformable registration based on minimizing As-Rigid-As-Possible Energy and Distance Field Gradient Energy
5. Morphing between registered meshes

!!!New!!! Video illustrating the current system.
